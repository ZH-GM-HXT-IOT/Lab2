lab2: interrupt and adc

checkpoint 1:
Change the brightness of an LED and the pitch of a piezo in accordance to readings from the light sensor. For example, the more light that reaches the sensor, the brighter the LED shines and the higher the pitch from the piezo will be

checkpoint 2:
Debounce a button press. At most, an interrupt should be generated once when the button is pushed and once when the button is let go.

checkpoint 3:
Create the combined system; the system is activated when the button is pressed and deactivated when released. While activated, the LED and piezo changes brightness and pitch depending on the light sensor readings.
